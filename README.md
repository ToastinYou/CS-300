SNHU CS-300 DSA: Analysis and Design

The problems being solved in the projects throughout this course were to research and experiment with different data structures. I researched the performance and when it is best to use each of the different data structures. It is important to understand the data structures at your disposable so the code is efficient and provides an appropriate output to the problem at hand. Any roadblocks I encountered I did further investigation and research mainly through Stackoverflow. Most of these data structures I did not have previous knowledge of, so I am glad that I had a chance to learn and gain experience using them.
